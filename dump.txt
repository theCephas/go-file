LESSON 1

// strings
	// var nameOne string = "mario"
	// var nameTwo = "Iseoluwa"
	// var nameThree string

	// fmt.Println(nameOne, nameTwo, nameThree)

	// nameOne = "peach"
	// nameThree = "Peter"

	// fmt.Println(nameOne, nameTwo, nameThree)

	// nameFour := "Victor"

	// fmt.Println(nameOne, nameTwo, nameThree, nameFour)

	// ints
	// var ageOne int = 3
	// var ageTwo = 20

	// ageThree := ageOne + ageTwo

	// fmt.Println(ageOne, ageTwo, ageThree)

	// bits and memory
	// var numOne int8 = 40
	// var numTwo int8 = -128
	// numThree uint8 := -100
	// fmt.Println(numOne, numTwo)

LESSON 2

Difference between Println and Print. Println does not need a line breaker to have a full sentence in a single line
but Print needs a line breaker to have a full sentence in a single line (\n).

// Printf (formatted strings)
	fmt.Printf("My name is %v, I am %v years old \n", name, age)
	fmt.Printf("you scored %0.2f points \n", 43.546)

	// Sprintf (save formatted strings)
	var str = fmt.Sprintf("My name is %v, I am %v years old \n", name, age)
	fmt.Println(str)

LESSON 3

Here, I am learning how to pass arrays and also use slices in golang. This made me understand the true concept of being a statically typed language.
So technically, rather than the conventional way of using square brackets to write arrays in either javascript or python, we use curly brackets to write arrays.

this is an example: var ages [3]int = [3]int{1, 2, 3}

Also, to check the length of an array, we use len(), to check the length of an array. Where, the variable would be inside the bracket of len.

SLICE
I am beginning to learn how slices are used where they are used to add or remove items from an array. Slices often use arrays under the hood.
Using the "append" function adds an item to the end of an array.

code snippet: var ages [3]int = [3]int{1, 2, 3}
	
	fmt.Println(ages, len(ages))

	//  Slices
	var scores = []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	scores = append(scores, 8)

	fmt.Println(scores, len(scores))

	// Slice ranges
	words := [6]string{"bells", "shoes", "fan", "cloth", "legs"}
	rangeOne := words[3:5]
	// Result is [cloth legs]
	rangeOne = words[2:5]
	// Result is [fan legs]
	
	fmt.Println(rangeOne)

LESSON 4

In this lesson, I am learning on packages. Here, I am able to install the correct go package because I have been making mistakes on the installation correctly before.
However, I have achieved the perfect installation. Also, I am learning about using the function Contains() to search if a string is within a string. This gives a result of a boolean property though.
The Contains() property accepts two arguments. The first argument is the variable name. While the second is the property to find

Another is ReplaceAll() which is used to replace property names. It takes in three arguments; var name, the old, the new.
Another is ToUpper()... You know that already. Yes yes to uppercase.
Another is Index(), which is used to find the index of a particular string or number. Mostly the position of the first one.
Another is Split(), which is used to separate the strings.

Also, we have the Sorts() property, which is used to arrange the integers or strings in an array.
Along with the SearchStrings() property to search for the location of a sorted variable. This is quite related to Contains() and Index().

snippets:
// greeting := "Hello, world!"

	// fmt.Println(strings.Split(greeting, "l"))

	// ages := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}

	// sort.Ints(ages)
	// fmt.Println(ages)

	// index := sort.SearchInts(ages, 30)
	// fmt.Println(index)
